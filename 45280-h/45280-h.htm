    <h3>
      A LOGICAL STORY.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ave you heard of
      the wonderful one-hoss-shay,
    </p>
    <p>
      That was built in such a logical way?
    </p>
    <p>
      It ran a hundred years to a day,
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, of a sudden, it&mdash;ah, but stay,
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll tell you what happened without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Scaring the parson into fits,
    </p>
    <p>
      Frightening people out of their wits,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you ever heard of that, I say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Seventeen hundred and fifty-five.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Georgius Secundus</i> was then alive,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Snuffy old drone from the German hive!
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the year when Lisbon-town
    </p>
    <p>
      Saw the earth open and gulp her down,
    </p>
    <p>
      And Braddock's army was done so brown,
    </p>
    <p>
      Left without a scalp to its crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /><br />

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was on the
      terrible Earthquake-day
    </p>
    <p>
      That the Deacon finished the one-hoss-shay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in building of chaises, I tell you what,
    </p>
    <p>
      There is always <i>somewhere</i> a weakest spot,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In hub, tire, felloe, in spring or thill,
    </p>
    <p>
      In panel, or crossbar, or floor, or sill,
    </p>
    <p>
      In screw, bolt, thoroughbrace,&mdash;lurking still
    </p>
    <p>
      Find it somewhere you must and will,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Above or below, or within or without,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And that's the reason, beyond a doubt,
    </p>
    <p>
      A chaise <i>breaks down</i>, but doesn't <i>wear out</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Deacon swore (as Deacons do)
    </p>
    <p>
      With an &ldquo;I dew vum,&rdquo; or an &ldquo;I tell <i>yeou</i>,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would build one shay to beat the taown
    </p>
    <p>
      'n' the keounty 'n' all the keuntry raoun';
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t should be so
      built that it <i>couldn'</i> break daown:

     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Deacon inquired of the village folk
    </p>
    <p>
      Where he could find the strongest oak,
    </p>
    <p>
      That couldn't be split nor bent nor broke,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was for spokes and floor and sills;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent for lancewood to make the thills;
    </p>
    <p>
      The crossbars were ash, from the straightest trees;
    </p>
    <p>
      The panels of white-wood, that cuts like cheese,
    </p>
    <p>
      But lasts like iron for things like these;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hubs of logs from the &ldquo;Settler's ellum,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Last of its timber,&mdash;they couldn't sell 'em,&mdash;

      Their blunt ends frizzled like celery-tips;

    <p>
      Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw,

      That was the way he &ldquo;put her through.&rdquo;&mdash;

      <i>Do!</i> I tell you, I rather guess

      Colts grew horses, beards turned gray,

    <p>
      Deacon and deaconess dropped away,

    <p>
      Children and grandchildren&mdash;where were they?

    <p>
      But there stood the stout old one-hoss-shay

    <p>
      As fresh as on Lisbon-earth-quake-day!

      Eighteen hundred increased by ten;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Hahnsum kerridge&rdquo; they called it then.

    <p>
      Eighteen hundred and twenty came:&mdash;

      In fact, there's nothing that keeps its youth,

    <p>
      So far as I know, but a tree and truth.

    </p>
    <p>
      Of joyous days and jolly nights, and merry Christmas chimes;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were a free and jovial race, but honest, brave and true,
    </p>
    <p>
      That dipped their ladle in the punch when this old bowl was new.

      A Spanish galleon brought the bar&mdash;so runs the ancient tale&mdash;

    <p>
      Twas hammered by an Antwerp smith, whose arm was like a flail;
    </p>
    <p>
      And now and then between the strokes, for fear his strength should fail,
    </p>
    <p>
      He wiped his brow, and quaffed a cup of good old Flemish ale.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas purchased by an English squire to please his loving dame,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who saw the cherubs, and conceived a longing for the same;

      That night, affrighted from his nest, the screaming eagle flew,

      He heard the Pequot's ringing whoop, the soldier's wild halloo;

      A hundred years, and fifty more, had spread their leaves and snows,

      A thousand rubs had flattened down each little cherub's nose;

    </p>
    <p>
      But what if the stormy cloud should come,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And ruffle the silver sea?
    </p>
    <p>
      Would he turn his eye from the distant sky,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To smile on a thing like thee?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      O no, fair Lily, he will not send
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      One ray from his far-off throne;
    </p>
    <p>
      The winds shall blow and the waves shall flow,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And thou wilt be left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There is not a leaf on the mountain top,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Nor a drop of evening dew,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor a golden sand on the sparkling shore,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Nor a pearl in the waters blue,
    </p>
    <p>
      That he has not cheered with his fickle smile,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And warmed with his faithless beam,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And will he be true to a pallid flower,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That floats on the quiet stream?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas for the Lily! she would not heed,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But turned to the skies afar.
    </p>
    <p>
      And bared her breast to the trembling ray
    </p>
    <p>
      That shot from the rising star;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloud came over the darkened sky,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And over the waters wide:
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked in vain through the beating rain,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And sank in the stormy tide.
